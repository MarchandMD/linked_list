So the challenge or the roadblock to this point has been the issue of recursively retrieving the `#data` elements WITHOUT destroying the list through manipulation of the head. 

What I've found is that I can access the actual data value in the nested objects, but how would I continue to retrieve them via a recursive function? 

This way, is it the input that's changing? 

Nah, that doesn't seem to want to work; I think what I need to do is continue to read and take notes from the articles. I know it'll take a while, but keep doing it. Keep taking it as slow as possible. And research other side things. 

hmm, i haven't even thought about how to remove an item from the list. 

I know how to add an item...but how are these things linked together? 

I mean, I suppose the point is that they all point to each other; but if I'm popping off the last one, which Node am I wanting to look at? 

I'm wanting to visit the Node who's `#next_node` is `nil`. Or, at least, what I want to do is I want to.....do what? I want to look at that Node, return it's data value, and then I want to move one place back in the list and make that the node who's next_node value is `nil`. 

but how do i both visit the last node, and remove it? 

Essentially what I'm needing to do is I'm needing to is change which node has a next_node value equal to nil. 

If I had a `@tail` variable, this would perhaps be a little easier. ok, so I didn't completely read the instructions; or I need to include `@tail` now...

The failure keeps happening; and what is the failure? the failure is, the expectation is is that the Node will be the value of the `list.tail`...but eerytime I call `list#tail` it's coming up nil. 

So why is it nil? What else can I test? How can I test this into passing?

So, I'm just learning, like on my own. There's nothing wrong with that. It's what I want to do; I've been working really hard on the LinkedList thing that it sort of burnt me out; and I don't want to keep working on that. At least not right now. No, i'd rather work on a passion project; because that's all I got to do. And that's all I really can do. I mean, I don't want to push anything with this hernia. So anyway, that's what I'm doing. 

I see a little bit of the code...and I feel like I might be able to make it a little better, by doing something with better methods, or more concise methods. 

So, I don't really know what to do next. 

I mean, I'm sort of working with this wrapper....but then what? 

I mean, I want to ramp up...but I don't really know how. 

So yeah. I mean, i'm able to do something. But by no means do I have the chops to be able to....but I'm learning. So just keep going. 

Well, what to do next?

I mean, I suppose I could build a little more...like try to make it a little more like a website. But i'm not to conerned with that. 

I mean, there is a lot that needs to be done. And a lot that will definitely help. 

I could build out a few more views and controllers...try to create some real content. But I don't know if I really want to do that. 

I mean, I do, but i odn't know if now is the right time to do that. But it's a little different than what I was doing. so maybe. 

And since I do this so infrequently, I don't really know how to do any of the other designing; Like, I don't know how to quickly add any bootstrap, to start adding cards, etc. 

Aside from just doing it the long way. I mean, that's one way to do it. 

And that way I know the fundamentals; and as I learn, I'll be able to pick up other things about it. Like how to do the other parts faster. 

And there are other things I could do, like figuring out how to grab all the players from the list. 

Yeah, so, what else to do? 

I mean, I feel kind of icky. Like, what I feel is sort of like....wasted. There's a lot to learn, and I've learned some of the stuff before, but it's sort of scatter shot. monkey-brained. I'm all over the place tryingn to do so much. 

But just a little at a time. Learning how to do small things helps me see the bigger things. Which is super helpful. 

I mean, why not? Why not take a run at this bigger thing? I solved a bigger issue. And now these other htings are sort of like, punching-down. 

I have a vague sort of idea what I'd like to do. So just do a little at a time.
