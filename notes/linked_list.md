# Linked Lists: the self-taught way

Not sure I'll have a lot more opportunities to write an article claiming to be self-taught since I've been accepted to the Turing program; However, linked lists are an "advanced" topic that I've covered on my own, so let me point out some ideas that were missing in the tutorials/videos/articles I've consumed. 

1. The LinkedList will be it's own object
2. The LinkedList will have a single instance variable
3. An instance variable is a great pointer!
4. The LinkedList will contain other objects; So it's objects (nodes) "in" an object (linkedlist)
5. Do not be afraid to re-define/re-assign values to variables!
6.
